# Image-Analysis

## Overview

The script processes image data, extracts relevant features, and uses a Random Forest Regressor to make predictions about product characteristics.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- requests
- Pillow (PIL)
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- tqdm

## Data

The project uses two main datasets:
1. `train.csv`: Contains training data with image links, group IDs, entity names, and entity values.
2. `test.csv`: Contains test data for prediction.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing

- Loads training and test data from CSV files.
- Extracts numeric values and units from the `entity_value` column using regex.
- Normalizes units to base units (e.g., grams, centimeters) for consistency.

### 2. Image Processing

- `load_image_from_url(url)`: Loads an image from a given URL.
- Displays sample images with their corresponding entity values for visual inspection.

### 3. Feature Engineering

- Encodes categorical `entity_name` using `LabelEncoder`.
- Creates features from `group_id` and encoded `entity_name`.

### 4. Model Training

- Uses `RandomForestRegressor` to predict normalized values.
- Splits data into training and validation sets.
- Trains the model and calculates Mean Squared Error on the validation set.

### 5. Prediction

- Applies the trained model to the test dataset.
- Generates predictions and saves them to 'test_out.csv'.

## Usage Instructions

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy requests pillow matplotlib scikit-learn tqdm
   ```

2. Prepare your data:
   - Place `train.csv` and `test.csv` in a known directory.
   - Update file paths in the script to point to your CSV files.

3. Run the script:
   ```
   python amazon_ml.py
   ```

4. Check the output:
   - The script will generate 'test_out.csv' containing predictions for the test dataset.
   - Review the console output for any errors or the validation Mean Squared Error.

## Code Structure

1. Library imports
2. Data loading
3. Data preprocessing and feature extraction
4. Image loading and visualization functions
5. Unit normalization
6. Feature encoding
7. Model training and validation
8. Prediction on test data
9. Output generation

## Potential Improvements

1. Implement more advanced image processing techniques to extract features directly from images.
2. Experiment with different machine learning models or ensemble methods.
3. Add more robust error handling and logging.
4. Implement cross-validation for more reliable model evaluation.
5. Optimize the code for larger datasets, possibly using parallel processing.

## Conclusion

This script provides a foundation for predicting product attributes based on image data and metadata. It demonstrates the basic workflow of a machine learning project, from data preprocessing to model training and prediction. Users can build upon this base to create more sophisticated product analysis tools for e-commerce applications.
